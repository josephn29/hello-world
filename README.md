Nate's First Repository for Practice
My name is Nathan Joseph. I have an 18 month old daughter. She is nearly the only thing in this world that gets me to step out of my head. Her mother and I have been married for going on three years now, but we have known each other for just under 11 years. I feel very lucky to have her; she keeps me grounded.
